        <h3>College and draft</h3>
            <p>LaRoche played shortstop for Grayson County College. He also played for the Keene Swamp Bats of the New England Collegiate Baseball League. In 2003, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Wareham Gatemen of the Cape Cod Baseball League and was named a league all-star.[1][2][3] He had been originally a catcher but switched positions due to an injury. He was originally drafted in the 21st round by the San Diego Padres in 2002, but he turned down an offer estimated at $200,000 and remained in school for another year. He re-entered the draft the following year, and, despite having broken a bone in his left leg in a collision at first base, his stock soared and scouts projected him as a first rounder. However, teams were concerned about their ability to sign him, as he had turned down the Padres' offer and was planning on transferring to Rice University.
            Nevertheless, he was drafted in the 39th round of the 2003 Major League Baseball draft by the Los Angeles Dodgers, but still got supplemental money when the Dodgers signed him in August 2003. At the time, his bonus was the highest for a "non draft and follow" outside the first three rounds.
